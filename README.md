# UTMIST Omni Generative Thought

The goal of Omni is to consolidate, link, and inform the user of relevant information when reading and writing. It offers many integrations, for example a Chrome extension that brings up the most relevant information as the user reads or writes in their browser. Omni allows users to conduct real-time search queries proactively over any text of choice, whether it be websites, books or private documents that they upload to the Omni database. This search is at the level of sentences which can be brought up as the user types, or in response to highlighting text in the browser. Information will appear in a toolbar at the right hand side of the user’s browser once they’ve opened the extension. The goal of this specific project is to automate certain processes of thought, such as contradiction, finding examples of a claim, assumption questioning, and so forth; and to integrate this automation feature into the Omni Chrome extension. For example, given a highlighted claim, e.g. highlighting “The earth is flat” on a YouTube comment, we aim to find and display sources that either a) contradict the claim, b) question assumptions of the claim, c) find a good example of the claim, and so on. The user should then be able to choose which process of thought they want to display results of via a dropdown menu in the Omni toolbar. This feature would supercharge a user’s ability to think critically as they read or write about any topic in real-time.
