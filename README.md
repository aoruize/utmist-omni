# UTMIST Omni Generative Thought

The goal of this project is to automate certain processes of thought, such as contradiction, finding examples of a claim, assumption questioning, and so forth; and to integrate this automation feature into the Omni Chrome extension. For example, given a highlighted claim, e.g. highlighting “The earth is flat” on a YouTube comment, we aim to find and display sources that either a) contradict the claim, b) question assumptions of the claim, c) find a good example of the claim, and so on. The user should then be able to choose which process of thought they want to display results of via a dropdown menu in the Omni toolbar. This feature would supercharge a user’s ability to think critically as they read or write about any topic in real-time.
